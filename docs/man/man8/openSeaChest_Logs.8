Utility Arguments
.br
=================
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR deviceHandle
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg?
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.IP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
.br
usb \- show only USB devices
.br
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
.br
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
.br
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
.br
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
.br
sd \- show sd device handles
.br
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
.br
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.

.HP
\fB\-\-farm\fR
.IP
Pull the Seagate Field Accessible Reliability Metrics (FARM)
Log from the specified drive.  Saves the binary logs to the
current directory as <serialnumber>_FARM_<date and time>.bin
.HP
\fB\-\-listErrorHistoryIDs\fR
.IP
Displays a list of all supported error history buffer IDs
supported by the device.
.HP
\fB\-\-listSupportedLogs\fR
.IP
Displays a list of all supported generic logs by this device
type.
.HP
\fB\-\-logMode [raw | bin]\fR
.IP
Sets the mode to pull the log. Use this option with --pullLog
to set the desired mode.
.br
raw - Pulls log & prints it to the screen as stdout. (default)
.br
bin - Pulls log & saves it to a timestamped binary file.  Saves
the binary logs to the current directory as
<serialnumber>_GENERIC_LOG-<decimal log number>_<date and
time>.bin
.HP
\fB\-\-logTransferLength [lengthunits (no space)]\fR
.IP
Use this option to specify the data transfer length for a log
transfer. Larger transfer sizes may speed up log retrieval at
the loss of compatibility. The following units are allowed for
specifying a transfer length:
.br
KiB - length in kibibytes (val * 1024)
.br
MiB - length in mebibytes (val * 1048576)
.br
KB  - length in kilobytes (val * 1000)      (SAS only)
.br
MB  - length in megabytes (val * 1000000)   (SAS only)
.br
BLOCKS or SECTORS - used to specify a transfer length
        in device in 512Byte blocks/sectors
.br
Warning: Specifying a large size may result in failures due to
OS, driver, or HBA/bridge specific limitations.
.IP
Examples: --logTransferLength 4KiB
.br
  --logTransferLength 1MiB
.br
  --logTransferLength 1BLOCKS
.br
  --logTransferLength 12288SECTORS
.IP
Notes: ATA drives must be given a value in 512B increments. If
--logTransferLength is omitted then various default lengths are
automatically set by the program depending on the type of log.
.HP
\fB\-\-pullErrorHistoryID [Buffer ID]\fR
.IP
Pulls specific error history buffer ID from the device [Buffer
ID] is required argument & can be passed as an decimal or hex
value.
.IP
WARNING:  Vendor Unique Logs pulled using this option may not
be valid due to unknown vendor unique bits in ATA/SCSI/NVMe
etc. command fields.
.HP
\fB\-\-pullLog [Log Number]\fR
.IP
Pulls the Host Specific generic log number from the device. [Log
Number] is a required argument and can be a decimal or hex
value.  For example, --pullLog FE, --pullLog FEh, --pullLog
0xFE, --pullLog 254, or --pullLog 0254.  Possible Log Numbers
are returned by the --listSupportedLogs command.  Also see
--logMode below.
.IP
Example: --pullLog 0x02 --logMode bin
.br
gives the file  <serialnumber>_GENERIC_LOG-2_<date and time>.bin
.IP
WARNING:  Vendor Unique Logs pulled using this option may not
be valid due to unknown vendor unique bits in ATA/SCSI/NVMe
etc. command fields.
.HP
\fB\-\-selfTestLog\fR
.IP
This option will pull the Self Test Results Log (DST) from a
device. On ATA drives, this will pull the extended SMART self
tests result log when it is supported by the device.  Saves the
binary logs to the current directory as
<serialnumber>_Ext_SMART_Self_Test_Results_<date and time>.bin

.PP

.HP
\fB\-\-enableLegacyUSBPassthrough\fR
.IP
Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire)
products that do not otherwise work with the tool.
This option will enable a trial and error method that
attempts sending various ATA Identify commands through
vendor specific means. Because of this, certain products
that may respond in unintended ways since they may interpret
these commands differently than the bridge chip the command
was designed for.
.HP
\fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.IP

be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATADMA\fR    (SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to DMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAPIO\fR    (SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO
commands to ATA device when possible. This option can
be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAUDMA\fR    (SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-forceSCSI\fR
