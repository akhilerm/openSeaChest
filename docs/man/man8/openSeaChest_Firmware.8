Utility Arguments
.br
=================
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR deviceHandle
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg?
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.IP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
.br
usb \- show only USB devices
.br
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
.br
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
.br
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
.br
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
.br
sd \- show sd device handles
.br
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
.br
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.TP
\fB\-\-activateFW\fR
.IP
Use this option to issue the command to activate code that was
sent to the drive using a deferred download command. This will
immediately activate the new code on the drive.
You can use this along with a \fB\-\-downloadFW\fR & \fB\-\-downloadMode\fR to
automatically issue the activate command after the download has
completed.
.HP
\fB\-\-calculateFileHash\fR [file]
.IP
Use this option to calculate the hash of a file.
The following hashes are computed and shown on the
screen:
.br
MD5 SHA1 SHA2_224 SHA2_256 SHA2_384 SHA2_512
.TP
\fB\-\-downloadFW\fR firmware_filename
.IP
Download firmware to a Seagate storage product. Use only
Seagate authorized firmware data files which are designated for
the specific model drive. Improper use of this option may harm
a device and or its data. You may specify the path if the
firmware data file is in a different location. This option will
use segmented download by default. Use the
\fB\-\-downloadMode\fR option to specify a different download mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-downloadMode\fR [ full | segmented | deferred ]
.IP
Use this option along with the \fB\-\-downloadFW\fR option
to set the firmware download mode.
Supported Modes:
.IP
full \- performs a download in one large transfer to the device.
.br
segmented \- downloads the firmware in multiple
segments to the device. (Most compatible)
.br
deferred \- performs a segmented download to the
device, but does not activate the new
firmware until a powercycle or activate
command is sent.
.TP
\fB\-\-firmwareSlot\fR/\-\-fwBufferID slot#
.IP
Use this option to specify a firmware slot (NVMe) or a buffer ID (SCSI)
along with the \fB\-\-downloadMode\fR (SCSI) or \fB\-\-activateFW\fR (NVMe & SCSI) options.
If this option is not used, a value of zero will be used instead,
which means the drive will automatically select the slot number.
.TP
\fB\-\-fwdlSegSize\fR [segment size in 512B blocks]
.IP
Use this option to specify a segment size in 512B blocks
to use for a segmented or deferred download. This option
will not affect an immediate download (full buffer at once).
The default segment size used is 64. Larger segment sizes
may be faster, however they may also be incompatible with
controllers or drivers in the system. Smaller values are
more likely to be compatible, but also slower.
Use this option if the default used by the tool is not
working correctly for firmware updates.
.HP
\fB\-\-fwdlInfo\fR
.IP
Use this option to show the firmware download support
information for a drive.
.PP
Utility Options
.br
===============
.HP
\fB\-\-echoCommandLine\fR
.IP
Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.
.HP
\fB\-\-enableLegacyUSBPassthrough\fR
.IP
Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire)
products that do not otherwise work with the tool.
This option will enable a trial and error method that
attempts sending various ATA Identify commands through
vendor specific means. Because of this, certain products
that may respond in unintended ways since they may interpret
these commands differently than the bridge chip the command
was designed for.
.HP
\fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATADMA\fR    (SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to DMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAPIO\fR    (SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO
commands to ATA device when possible. This option can
be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAUDMA\fR    (SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-forceSCSI\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)
Please report bugs/suggestions to seaboard@seagate.com.
Include the output of \fB\-\-version\fR information in the email.
.HP
\fB\-\-license\fR
.IP
Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).
.HP
\fB\-\-modelMatch\fR [model Number]
.IP
Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
model number. This option will provide a closest match although
an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001
.HP
\fB\-\-newFW\fR [firmware revision]
.IP
Use this option to skip drives matching the provided
firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
This option should be used to skip performing an update if
a drive already has this firmware revision loaded.
.HP
\fB\-\-onlyFW\fR [firmware revision]
.IP
Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
.HP
\fB\-\-onlySeagate\fR
.IP
Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
provided
.HP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.IP
Run openSeaChest_Firmware in quiet mode. This is the same as
\fB\-v\fR 0 or \fB\-\-verbose\fR 0
.HP
\fB\-\-sat12byte\fR
.IP
This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec
ATA Pass\-through 12 byte commands when possible instead
of 16 byte commands. By default, 16 byte commands are
always used for ATA Pass\-through.
.HP
\fB\-v\fR [0\-4], \fB\-\-verbose\fR [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
.IP
Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are:
.br
